# WooCommerce-Conditional-Shipping-Methods-Based-on-ACF-Custom-Fields

This code is to create conditional shipping options based on ACF custom fields in WooCommerce. 

I have also added an option to clear Redis Cache & WooCommerce Transients.

If your server doesn't have Redis Cache then you can ignore that part of the code.

You can keep the clearing WooCommerce Transients part as that is required to update the cart as & when cart is updated or product is updated.
